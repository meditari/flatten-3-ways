# Flatten - Served 3 Ways

Speed comparisons of three array flattening methods in JavaScript

(1) Array reduce method based recursion
(2) Single "for" loop based recursion
(2) Nested "for" loop based recursion

Example Output:

Performing 100 iterations of reduce based flatten method...
test-flatten.html:17 Execution time for reduce based flatten method: 898.1500000000002 ms
test-flatten.html:18 Performing 100 iterations of single "for" loop flatten method...
test-flatten.html:22 Execution time for single "for" loop flatten method: 260.09999999999957 ms
test-flatten.html:23 Performing 100 iterations of nested "for" loop flatten method...
test-flatten.html:27 Execution time for nested "for" loop flatten method: 25.639999999999645 ms
test-flatten.html:30 Single "for" loop is 71.04% faster than reduce
test-flatten.html:31 Nested "for" loop is 90.14% faster than single "for" loop.
test-flatten.html:32 Nested "for" loop is 97.15% faster than reduce
